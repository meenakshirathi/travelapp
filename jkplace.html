        <p>Located in Trikuta hills 13 Kms from Katra at a height of 1560 m above sea level with shimmering clouds and thinning air, this town is the holy cave temple of Mata Vaishnodevi.</p>
        
        <h2>GulMarg:</h2>
        
        <p>Situated at an altitude of 2730 m above sea level, Gulmarg is surrounded by snow covered mountains, lush green meadows, deep ravines, evergreen forested hills and valleys.</p>
        
        <h2>Jammu:</h2>

        
        <p>Be it the multi-hued flags representing the temples and shrines in the city, the tantalizing aromas that lift and diffuse from its spectacular cuisine or even the snow capped mountains that promise adventure and action, this 'City of Temples' has something to offer to everyone.</p>
